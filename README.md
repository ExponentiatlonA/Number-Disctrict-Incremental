# Number-Disctrict-Incremental
A game still in beta literally just having one 2 buttons
⚠️⚠️⚠️THE GAME DOES NOT HAVE SAVING YET!!!⚠️⚠️⚠️

Heres the lore:

There was a man who loved numbers so much, he deticaded a whole factory to just print numbers on a website. He waited hours and hours until the man finally got his first number, a one!
And after another hour a 2!
and so on until he got 100!
Now he was able to upgrade his factory and go on with his life since it was automated.
